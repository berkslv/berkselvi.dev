          Hello! My name is Berk Selvi and I am a full-stack web developer specializing in backend and interested in data science. I am currently studying Computer Science at NamÄ±k Kemal University and I am also developing side projects that solves real-world problems, and I love doing that!

     <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Over the past three years, I've built websites for my clients as a freelance developer. When I started university, I trained myself with theoretical knowledge from various sources such as MIT and Stanford. After believing that I was at a sufficient level, I started to develop complex projects like <a href="https://github.com/berkslv/social-media-app">full-stack social media app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/berkslv/c-web-server">C multithread web server</a>
     </li>
     <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Having a vision from long and varied work experience, I have acquired skills such as responsibility, team player, time management and problem solving. I am confident that my vision and soft skills will help me in projects that I will develop alone or as a team member.
