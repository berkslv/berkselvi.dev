In the dynamic landscape of microservices architecture, the need for robust security has become much more important. As organizations break down their applications into smaller, independently deployable services, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between these services becomes a critical concern.

In this blog post, we will explore a comprehensive solution for securing microservices using Ocelot, an API Gateway with Keycloak, a powerful open-source identity and access management solution. By placing Keycloak behind the API Gateway, weâ€™ll delve into how this integration safeguards resources, authenticates requests to other services, and authorizes access using claims, offering a seamless and secure communication framework for your microservices ecosystem. Letâ€™s get started.

## Create Keycloak instance

Running keycloak within Docker is very easy. Just place this Dockerfile in /Identity directory in your project. You can find all of the codes in my repository from end of the post.

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest as builder  
  
# Enable health and metrics support  
ENV KC_HEALTH_ENABLED=true  
ENV KC_METRICS_ENABLED=true  
  
# Configure a database vendor  
ENV KC_DB=postgres  
  
WORKDIR /opt/keycloak  
# for demonstration purposes only, please make sure to use proper certificates in production instead  
RUN keytool -genkeypair -storepass password -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -dname "CN=server" -alias server -ext "SAN:c=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1" -keystore conf/server.keystore  
RUN /opt/keycloak/bin/kc.sh build  
  
FROM quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest  
COPY --from=builder /opt/keycloak/ /opt/keycloak/  
  
# change these values to point to a running postgres instance  
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/keycloak/bin/kc.sh"]
```

And create docker-compose.yml file that access /Identity/Dockerfile and builds image from it. We can use base image rather than custom Dockerfile but with this approach you can customize much more features of Keycloak like frontend theme and secret keys.

```yaml
version: "3"  
  
services:  
  # PostgreSQL for keycloak  
  secured-identity-db:  
    container_name: secured-identity-db  
    image: postgres:16-alpine  
    ports:  
      - 6063:5432  
    expose:  
      - 6063  
    volumes:  
      - ./data/secured-identity-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data  
    restart: always  
    environment:  
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myStrongPassword123  
      - POSTGRES_USER=keycloak  
      - POSTGRES_DB=keycloak  
    networks:  
      - secured-network  
  
  # Keycloak  
  secured-identity:  
    container_name: secured-identity  
    build: ./Keycloak  
    command: ["start-dev"]  
    ports:  
      - 5053:8080  
    expose:  
      - 5053  
    environment:  
      - KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin  
      - KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin  
      - KC_HOSTNAME_URL=http://localhost:5050/identity  
      - KC_DB=postgres  
      - KC_DB_USERNAME=keycloak  
      - KC_DB_PASSWORD=myStrongPassword123  
      - KC_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://secured-identity-db:5432/keycloak  
    depends_on:   
      - secured-identity-db  
    networks:  
      - secured-network  
  
networks:  
  secured-network:  
    driver: bridge  
  
volumes:  
  secured-data:  
    driver: local
```

And we just need to run docker from this docker-compose.yml file.

```bash
docker compose build  
docker compose up -d
```

## Put keycloak behind Ocelot API Gateway to protect resources

It is important to secure your identity service (keycloak) and reduce the attack vector by limiting the endpoints that can receive requests like other services. Keycloak admin panel should not be accessed from an external network, only people on this network can access this feature. For further readings consider visit Keycloak documentation about [Using a reverse proxy](https://www.keycloak.org/server/reverseproxy).

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/Exposed-path-recommendations.webp" alt="Exposed path recommendations" loading="lazy" />
<p class="image-sub-title">Exposed path recommendations</p>

First, letâ€™s create Ocelot project. I use Dotnet 8

```bash
dotnet new sln -n Secured  
dotnet new webapi -o Secured.ApiGateway  
cd Secured.ApiGateway/  
dotnet add package Ocelot --version 22.0.1
```

After we successfully created the project, modify Program.cs as follows and create ocelot.json file in root directory.

```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  
  
builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("ocelot.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);  
  
builder.Services.AddOcelot(builder.Configuration);  
  
var app = builder.Build();  
  
await app.UseOcelot();  
await app.RunAsync();
```

After that, we can use this ocelot.json file to limit access to our keycloak application running on localhost:5053.

```json
{  
  "Routes": [  
    {  
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/realms/{everything}",  
      "DownstreamScheme": "http",  
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [  
        {  
          "Host": "localhost",  
          "Port": 5053  
        }  
      ],  
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/identity/realms/{everything}",  
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get", "Post", "Put", "Delete" ]  
    },  
    {  
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/resources/{everything}",  
      "DownstreamScheme": "http",  
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [  
        {  
          "Host": "localhost",  
          "Port": 5053  
        }  
      ],  
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/identity/resources/{everything}",  
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get" ]  
    },  
    {  
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/js/{everything}",  
      "DownstreamScheme": "http",  
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [  
        {  
          "Host": "localhost",  
          "Port": 5053  
        }  
      ],  
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/identity/js/{everything}",  
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get" ]  
    }  
  ],  
  "GlobalConfiguration": {  
    "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:5050"  
  }  
}
```

After this configurations you can access keycloak from localhost:5050 that is the API Gatewayâ€™s address. After these configurations, you can access keycloak from localhost:5050, which is the address of the API Gateway, but you will not be able to access the Keycloak admin panel through this address because we have limited access.

For making our Keycloak configurations, we can log in to the admin panel at the keycloak address that is still accessible locally, that is, localhost:5053. Note that in the deployment scenario, we will ensure that only Ocelot has access to the external internet.

In localhost:5053 we can enter **admin** for username and **admin** for password. We can change this credentials from docker-compose.yml file.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-1.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

After logged in we create new realm for managing users and client for our application from this dropdown menu. After clicking the Create realm button, simply enter the **secured** as the realm name and leave everything as is.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-2.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

In clients tab click Create client. name Client ID as **postman** and valid redirect uri as  [**https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback**](https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback). leave other things as is.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-3.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

In the users tab, add users to log in to Keycloak.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-4.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

After these steps we can login to our keycloak with newly created user to get access token. For accessing API gateway I use Postman. In postman you can logged in with Keycloak. In Authorization section select OAuth 2.0 and configure as follows and click Get New Access Token. Postman will open browser window and redirect you to Keycloak login page, enter credentials for your new user. Donâ€™t enter admin credentials, this credentials only valid in master realm.

```txt
Grant type: Authorization code  
Auth URL: http://localhost:5050/identity/realms/secured/protocol/openid-connect/auth  
Access Token URL: http://localhost:5050/identity/realms/secured/protocol/openid-connect/token  
Client ID: postman  
Scope: openid profile roles
```

If you did everything right, you have successfully authenticated using Postaman with Keycloak behind the API Gateway ðŸŽ‰

## Authenticate requests to other services

If you want to authenticate a request in Ocelot, make the following updates to Program.cs and ocelot.json. MetadataAddress gets the keys required for JWT validation. However, if you want to avoid extra network calls, you can place the keys in the appsettings.json file and use them.

Authentication completed with AuthenticationOptions in ocelot.json file, here we say that we will send our JWT token along with the Bearer prefix and JWT token validation done with configuration from Program.cs

```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  
  
builder.Services  
    .AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)  
    .AddJwtBearer(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, o =>  
    {  
        o.MetadataAddress = "http://localhost:5050/identity/realms/secured/.well-known/openid-configuration";  
        o.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;  
        o.Authority = "http://localhost:5050/realms/secured";  
        o.Audience = "account";  
    });  
  
builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("ocelot.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);  
  
  
builder.Services.AddOcelot(builder.Configuration);  
  
var app = builder.Build();  
  
app.UseAuthentication();  
app.UseAuthorization();  
  
await app.UseOcelot();  
await app.RunAsync();
```

```json
{  
    "Routes": [  
      {  
        "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/get",  
        "DownstreamScheme": "https",  
        "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [  
          {  
            "Host": "httpbin.org",  
            "Port": 443  
          }  
        ],  
        "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/test",  
        "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get" ],  
        "AuthenticationOptions": {  
          "AuthenticationProviderKey": "Bearer"  
        }  
      },  
  
//...
```

## Authorize requests to other services

Authorization is slightly more difficult and requires additional work because Keycloak place user roles in nested form in JWT payload. It is something like following. As you can see roles field is placed under realm_access field. This creates confusion in Ocelot, because Ocelot reads claims as string or object values and does not evaluate nested fields. To avoid this problem we configure Keycloak token mapper and donâ€™t use nested form.

```json
{  
  //...  
  "exp": 1706600524,  
  "realm_access": {  
    "roles": [  
      "offline_access",  
      "default-roles-microcommerce",  
      "uma_authorization",  
      "customer"  
    ]  
  },  
  "resource_access": {  
    "account": {  
      "roles": [  
        "manage-account",  
        "manage-account-links",  
        "view-profile"  
      ]  
    }  
  },  
  "scope": "openid email profile",  
  "preferred_username": "berkslv",  
}
```

For this custom mapping, click Client scopes from left menu and select roles.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-5.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

Under the roles, select Mappers section and then click realm roles.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-6.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

In the menu that opens, realm_access.roles is entered in the Token Claim Name option. We update this to **realm_roles**.

<img src="/img/how-to-use-ocelot-and-keycloak-together-to-secure-microservices-from-api-gateway/keycloak-7.webp" alt="Keycloak" loading="lazy" />

After making these configurations, we update our token by logging in again via Postman. We make the following update in the ocelot.json file so that the requests we make with the updated token are subject to claim control by Ocelot. If we donâ€™t have **customer** role in our user we get 403 response. You can create and assing your custom roles in Keycloak admin panel.

```json
{  
    "Routes": [  
      {  
        "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/get",  
        "DownstreamScheme": "https",  
        "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [  
          {  
            "Host": "httpbin.org",  
            "Port": 443  
          }  
        ],  
        "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/test",  
        "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get" ],  
        "AuthenticationOptions": {  
          "AuthenticationProviderKey": "Bearer"  
        },  
        "RouteClaimsRequirement": {  
          "realm_roles": "customer"  
        }  
      },  
  
//...
```
