Some of you can think practice more important than knowledge, but trust me, if you don‚Äôt know something about your working area, you won‚Äôt get practice, and if you can, it won‚Äôt work, because you don‚Äôt know the underlying processes.</p><p>This guide is simple and results oriented, you can learn more about it with <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick>this great book</a>.</p><h2 id=before-the-learning>Before the learning<a href=#before-the-learning class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Mind is not fixed and can be developed, not only mind and IQ, intellectual skills also be developed with working. First of all you must have iron-strong self discipline, this can be earned in different ways, but you must find and follow your own path. If you wish, you can follow the military discipline methods, or you can stay loyal to the Far East philosophies. It‚Äôs entirely up to you.</p><p>And remember, valuable things like money accumulate. This includes knowledge, and the more you learn new things, the easier it is to learn and make sense of new things.</p><h2 id=not-the-learning>Not the learning<a href=#not-the-learning class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Studying the same subject over and over, reading the same things over and over can create a sense of learning, but this is most likely a wrong feeling. sense of learning and fluency can easily be confused with each other.</p><p>Don‚Äôt go ahead without testing yourself, you might think you learned that way, but most likely it also will be a false feeling.</p><h2 id=things-to-do>Things to do<a href=#things-to-do class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Recalling from memory is a much more wonderful method compared to methods such as repeated reading. When reading articles, pause at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs and ask, ‚ÄúWhat is the main idea? What is the message you want to give?‚Äù asking questions like this is a great practice for our callback method. In this way, mental connections related to the subjects learned will be strengthened.</p><p>End-of-chapter questions and self-created questions are great learning methods. It can be used here in quizzes and exams, Using Quizzes as a learning tool may be unorthodox in terms of danger, but works very well for recall and your answers to the questions are important. You can reveal your shortcomings in this way and completing these areas will move you forward.</p><p>These two methods are all about callback. The final word on the recall is that the more challenging, the more permanent its effects will be.</p><p>Instead of using the short-term benefits of block work, approaching the subject with intermittent work will make the knowledge more permanent. The required range depends on the subject and person being studied. Like 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. Trying to remember a subject periodically makes it permanent in the memory and now it becomes like a reflex.</p><p>Solving similar questions on a math topic one after another creates a feeling of familiarity, but it does not help you see the differences and similarities with other questions on the same topic at the time of practice. If you notice that you are repeating questions while solving questions, immediately switch to different types of questions.</p><p>Adding new layers of meaning to the subject you are learning is elaboration. An example of this is expressing a topic in your own words while taking notes and examining its relationship with real life. Examining the relationship of the newly learned subject with what you have learned before increases learning. Relate the topic to yourself and your life.</p><p>Produce before learning. Trying to solve a math question with what you know before the answer is given makes it easier for you to grasp and remember the solution after the solution is explained.</p><p>Blend recall and detailing. After a topic or class, ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow did it go? Could it be better? Does this remind you of something from the past?‚Äù Asking questions like these helps learning, and this is called <strong>reflection</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a href=#conclusion class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Thank you for reading! üéâ In order not to miss my research in the field of software development, you can follow me at <a href=https://x.com/berkslv>@berkslv</a>.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://berkselvi.dev/posts/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-with-nginx-using-docker-with-react-router-dom/><span class=button__icon>‚Üê</span>
