&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">CMD&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;nginx&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;-g&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;daemon off;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>]&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This Dockerfile uses the official Node runtime as the parent image to install and build the React app. It then uses the official Nginx runtime as the parent image to serve the React app.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="step-2-create-an-nginx-configuration-file">Step 2: Create an Nginx configuration file&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Next, we need to create an Nginx configuration file to tell Nginx how to serve our React app. Here is an example configuration file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-conf" data-lang="conf">server {
listen 80;
server_name example.com;
root /usr/share/nginx/html;
index index.html;
location / {
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>&lt;strong>You must create this &lt;code>nginx.conf&lt;/code> file in the same directory with Dockerfile.&lt;/strong> This configuration file sets up Nginx to listen on port 80 and serve the React app. The try_files directive tells Nginx to try serving the requested file, then the directory containing the file, and finally fall back to serving the index.html file if the requested file or directory doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="step-3-build-the-docker-image">Step 3: Build the Docker image&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With the Dockerfile and Nginx configuration file created, we can now build the Docker image. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>docker build -t my-react-app .
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag it with the name my-react-app. The . at the end of the command tells Docker to use the current directory as the build context.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="step-4-run-the-docker-container">Step 4: Run the Docker container&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With the Docker image built, we can now run a container using the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>docker run -p 80:80 my-react-app
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command creates a container from the my-react-app Docker image and maps port 80 in the container to port 80 on the host machine. You can then access your React app by navigating to http://localhost in your web browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Congratulations, you have successfully deployed a React app with Nginx using Docker! You can now use this method to easily deploy your React apps to any server or hosting platform that supports Docker.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="step-5-use-docker-compose-to-deploy-the-app">Step 5: Use Docker Compose to deploy the app&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you prefer a more streamlined approach to deploying your app, you can use Docker Compose to manage your containers. Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use Docker Compose, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory of your project. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example docker-compose.yml file that you can use with the Dockerfile provided earlier:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">version&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;3&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">services&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">my-react-app&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">build&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">context&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">.&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">dockerfile&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">Dockerfile&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">ports&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;80:80&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">volumes&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">./ngnix.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In this docker-compose.yml file, we define a single service named my-react-app. We specify the build context as the current directory (.), and the name of the Dockerfile as Dockerfile. We also map port 80 in the container to port 80 on the host machine using the ports configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we mount a volume that maps the ngnix.conf file on the host machine to the default.conf file in the container&amp;rsquo;s Nginx configuration directory. This allows us to customize the Nginx configuration without having to rebuild the Docker image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use this docker-compose.yml file, simply navigate to the directory containing the file and run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>docker-compose up -d
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command tells Docker Compose to build the my-react-app service using the Dockerfile and run a container. The -d flag runs the container in detached mode, which means that it runs in the background. You can then access your React app by navigating to http://localhost in your web browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a React app with Nginx using Docker and Docker Compose. You can now easily deploy your React apps to any server or hosting platform that supports Docker.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>How to download website with all assets and sub pagess, with one line command!</title><link>https://berkselvi.dev/posts/how-to-download-website-with-all-assets-and-sub-pages-with-one-line-command/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 11:01:10 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://berkselvi.dev/posts/how-to-download-website-with-all-assets-and-sub-pages-with-one-line-command/</guid><description>There may be times when you need to download an entire website, including all of its pages, images, and styles.

This can be useful for archiving a website, creating a local copy for offline viewing, or for creating a backup. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a popular tool that you can use to download an entire website: &lt;strong>wget&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>wget is a command-line tool that can be used to download files from the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool that can be used to download a single file, a group of files, or an entire website. To download an entire website using wget, you can use the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget -r -np -k -p -E -nc &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>website URL&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command tells wget to download the website recursively (-r), not to ascend to the parent directory (-np), to make links to files on the same server point to local files (-k), to download all necessary assets (-p), to adjust the extension of the files it saves (-E) and to not download files if they are already present in your local copy (-nc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that not all websites allow for their content to be downloaded in this way. Some websites may have terms of service that prohibit the use of automated tools to download their content. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s also important to respect website&amp;rsquo;s copyright and legal restrictions while downloading any website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, wget are two powerful tool that can be used to download an entire website, including all of its pages, images, and styles. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that you have the legal right to download the website, and to respect the website&amp;rsquo;s terms of service. Remember that downloading a website should be done only for legitimate purposes and not for any malicious intent.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>The Future of Backend Development: Predictions and Trends</title><link>https://berkselvi.dev/posts/the-future-of-backend-development-predictions-and-trends/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 11:01:10 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://berkselvi.dev/posts/the-future-of-backend-development-predictions-and-trends/</guid><description>The Future of Backend Development: Predictions and Trends As a backend developer, you are always looking for ways to improve your skills and stay ahead of the curve. One way to do this is to keep an eye on the future of backend development and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and predictions.

&lt;p>As a backend developer, you are always looking for ways to improve your skills and stay ahead of the curve. One way to do this is to keep an eye on the future of backend development and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and predictions. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a closer look at what the future of backend development might look like, and consider some of the trends and predictions that experts are making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>## Cloud&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest trends in backend development is the increasing use of cloud computing. Cloud computing allows developers to build and run applications and services on remote servers, rather than on local servers or personal computers. This has a number of benefits, including scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. As a result, many experts believe that cloud computing will continue to play a major role in backend development in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="containers">Containers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another trend in backend development is the growing use of containerization technologies, such as Docker. Containerization allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into lightweight containers that can be easily deployed and run on any platform. This makes it easier to build and deploy applications, and makes it easier to scale them as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>## Microservices&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A third trend in backend development is the increasing use of microservices architecture. In a microservices architecture, an application is broken down into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of one another. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex applications, and allows developers to make changes and updates more quickly and easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>## AI powered development&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to these trends, there are also a number of predictions about the future of backend development. One prediction is that machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) will play a larger role in backend development in the future. For example, machine learning algorithms could be used to optimize the performance of backend systems, or to automate certain tasks that are currently performed manually. Another prediction is that the use of low-code and no-code platforms will increase, making it easier for developers to build and deploy backend systems without having to write a lot of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Overall, it is clear that the future of backend development is bright, with many exciting trends and predictions on the horizon. Whether you are just starting out as a backend developer or are a seasoned pro, it is important to stay up-to-date with these trends and predictions, and to continue learning and growing your skills. By doing so, you can ensure that you are well-prepared for the future of backend development and that you are able to take advantage of the many opportunities that are likely to come your way.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>How to translate 400 lines of code comment to English in 5 minutes?

&lt;p>My &lt;a href="https://github.com/college-hub">CollegeHub&lt;/a> service project will be publicly released on GitHub very soon. I wrote the docs in Turkish, which is my native language, for convenience during the development phase, but in principle, I do not want to use a language other than English in the software source file 😁.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lets-jump-right-into-how-i-do-this">Let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into how I do this.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I use VSC as IDE and I wrote my codes in C#. First, let&amp;rsquo;s explain the steps one by one and take a look at the details:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I copied the comments on lines containing &amp;ldquo;//&amp;rdquo; into a txt file.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I copied the contents of the txt file containing line-by-line comments and made a machine translation using Google Translate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I handled the translation of each file separately, file by file.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I updated the words matching the Bash Script with their English.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="step-1">Step 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I selected all the comments containing &amp;ldquo;//&amp;rdquo; in a file with &lt;code>Ctrl+D&lt;/code>, copied and pasted them into the &amp;ldquo;translate.tr.txt&amp;rdquo; file. I then cleared the Comment marks. I have a file like below. In this way, I gathered the comments of all the files that I will translate in a single file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># translate.tr.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- AuthManager.cs
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Kayıt işleminden önce validasyon yapılır.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Parola hashlenerek oluşturulur.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- CommentManager.cs
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Verilen id ile Post döndürülür.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Post kontrol edilir.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># translate.en.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- AuthManager.cs
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Validation is done before registration.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>It is created by hashing the password.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- CommentManager.cs
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Post is returned with the given id.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>The post is checked.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="step-2">Step 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this file, I selected all of them with &lt;code>Ctrl+A&lt;/code> and translated them via Google Translate. If this txt file is too long, you can do this translation piece by piece (that&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-3">Step 3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To run the bash script, I kept the translations and original versions of each script files in two separate files. I have created the following three files in the same location as the source files.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>|- translate.AuthManager.en.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>|- translate.AuthManager.tr.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>|- replace.bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="step-4">Step 4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are at the most exciting part, bash script writing. I am definitely not a Bash Script guru, I only learn the part that I may need thanks to Google, but I plan to improve myself in this subject in the near future because with Bash Script you gain a lot of flexibility on the file system. If we explain the following piece of code simply;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the variables containing the filenames are defined, then the while loop is opened for the file &lt;code>tr&lt;/code> (The loop repeats the number of rows.), while in the while the matching lines in the file &lt;code>en&lt;/code> are read (take care that the translations are on the same lines.). Finally, the matching texts are updated using the &lt;code>sed&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash

In this article, I will talk about the cornerstones of this philosophy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be a responsible person&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don’t ruin anything in your code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don’t be a perfectionist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your asset is your knowledge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop your community!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="be-a-responsible-person">Be a responsible person&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a programmer, if there is an error in the JavaScript code you write, you cannot say that the reason for this error is C++ compiler. This may sound a nonsense, but consider adapting this situation to yourself!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you take a job, plan the requirements of that job well because that doesn’t happen when you’ve come a long way in the project and when you go to a client or your boss they ask you a valid question, “why didn’t you think of this before” If there’s a mistake and you’re going to explain it, be prepared for any questions It would be good because it can help you get out of such situations. But the answer you give should definitely not be something “that is impossible to do!”. You should try to offer different solution alternatives suitable for that problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dont-ruin-anything-in-your-code">Don’t ruin anything in your code&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Think of software like a building, if a window in an apartment is broken and not repaired, if another window is broken and no one cares, this will continue and eventually graffiti will appear on the walls and the building will start to go completely disorganized. Later; never live with a broken glass. This example of broken glass for software can be bad design, and a poor code that can lead to future bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually this situation is quite scientific, if you think about entropy in physics, disorder always wants to increase. It is up to you to not allow this. If there is a bug in the software, focus on fixing it before adding a new feature and keep going.Don’t say you can’t do it, say you did.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dont-be-a-perfectionist">Don’t be a perfectionist&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you have a great idea, after a year or two of working on it and publishing it, it can be incredibly disappointing to learn from the feedback that it’s a really worthless idea. Before making flawless progress on any project, it makes much more sense to have an MVP with the core features of that project and release it, evaluate the feedback, and if all is well, keep moving forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, perfectionism usually doesn’t work for software. It’s a better idea to be sure of the product first and then perfect it. As a result, the world is changing every day and new technologies and products are emerging every minute!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="your-asset-is-your-knowledge">Your asset is your knowledge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your knowledge and experience is your most important asset. But these assets may be out of date, especially in the world of technology, everything is changing very quickly. The valuable assets you owned 1 year ago may now be worthless. That’s why you should focus on staying up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing a portfolio of knowledge and experience is like managing financial assets and has certain requirements;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Serious investors invest regularly as a habit: if you invest regularly, whether you make a little or a lot, you will get a huge profit in total in return.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Diversification is the key to long-term success: The more technology you are comfortable with, the better you can adapt to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Smart investors balance their portfolios between low risk, low return and high risk, high return investments: Investing your entire asset (time and effort) in a high return asset that you think will be valuable in the future. Instead, branch your entity into secure branches and don’t put your entire entity in the same box.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum returns: investing in assets that you think will appreciate in the future can yield big returns.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically: We do business in a highly volatile industry, so you should regularly review your investments and watch out for depreciating assets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>But the most important and indispensable of all these goals is to invest regularly. If you don’t invest, it doesn’t make any sense where you invest. Here are a few tools you can use as a tool to achieve these goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages ​​solve the same problems in different ways. Learning a few different approaches can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Read a technical book every quarter. Once you get used to it, read a book a month. Once you’ve mastered the technologies you’re currently using, branch out and work on some unrelated branches.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Read in non-technical books either. Computers are for humans, and if you can understand humans better, you can approach their solutions much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Join local user groups. Don’t just go and listen, participate actively. Isolation can be fatal to your career.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It doesn’t matter if you’ve used any of the technologies you’ll learn about in a project or even put it on your resume. Learning these will increase your learning ability and contribute to your problem solving ability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you encounter a problem and you don’t know the answer to it, choose it as a goal and try to learn it. Ask a guru, if he isn’t around, find one online. This will both answer the problem and expand its network. Keep learning constantly. Carry and evaluate something to read in dead moments like traveling on the bus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as the product that a bookstore is marketing to you is not the best product it has, but a product it is only trying to sell, don’t rely on the content that comes first in search engines, think about its accuracy. and weigh it in your mind and never accept it without question.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="develop-your-community">Develop your community!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A good idea is an orphan when you don’t have effective communication. As developers, we use our communication skills when communicating with end users or creating documentation, communicating with our bosses or superiors. Here are a few ways to strengthen your communication skills;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Your job as a programmer is not to play word games, but to convey the information you want accurately and clearly. Plan what you want to say. Write a draft. Then ask yourself, “Does this encompass everything I’m trying to say?” Repeat until you meet this requirement. Make this plan not just when writing a document, but before meetings and speeches, even before meeting with clients you care about.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you can convey information, you can ensure correct communication. Therefore, you need to determine the level of knowledge that the other person can meet.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There are various ways of communication. Some customers may want to be informed by e-mail, while others may want to be called by phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you want to be listened to by people, the first thing you will do is listen to them. If you can turn a meeting into a dialogue, there’s no better than you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Don’t make people wait by saying I will get back to you, I will answer as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>

Some of you can think practice more important than knowledge, but trust me, if you don’t know something about your working area, you won’t get practice, and if you can, it won’t work, because you don’t know the underlying processes.

Some of you can think practice more important than knowledge, but trust me, if you don’t know something about your working area, you won’t get practice, and if you can, it won’t work, because you don’t know the underlying processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide is simple and results oriented, you can learn more about it with &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick">this great book&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="before-the-learning">Before the learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mind is not fixed and can be developed, not only mind and IQ, intellectual skills also be developed with working. First of all you must have iron-strong self discipline, this can be earned in different ways, but you must find and follow your own path. If you wish, you can follow the military discipline methods, or you can stay loyal to the Far East philosophies. It’s entirely up to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And remember, valuable things like money accumulate. This includes knowledge, and the more you learn new things, the easier it is to learn and make sense of new things.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="not-the-learning">Not the learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Studying the same subject over and over, reading the same things over and over can create a sense of learning, but this is most likely a wrong feeling. sense of learning and fluency can easily be confused with each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t go ahead without testing yourself, you might think you learned that way, but most likely it also will be a false feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="things-to-do">Things to do&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recalling from memory is a much more wonderful method compared to methods such as repeated reading. When reading articles, pause at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs and ask, “What is the main idea? What is the message you want to give?” asking questions like this is a great practice for our callback method. In this way, mental connections related to the subjects learned will be strengthened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>End-of-chapter questions and self-created questions are great learning methods. It can be used here in quizzes and exams, Using Quizzes as a learning tool may be unorthodox in terms of danger, but works very well for recall and your answers to the questions are important. You can reveal your shortcomings in this way and completing these areas will move you forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These two methods are all about callback. The final word on the recall is that the more challenging, the more permanent its effects will be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of using the short-term benefits of block work, approaching the subject with intermittent work will make the knowledge more permanent. The required range depends on the subject and person being studied. Like 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. Trying to remember a subject periodically makes it permanent in the memory and now it becomes like a reflex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solving similar questions on a math topic one after another creates a feeling of familiarity, but it does not help you see the differences and similarities with other questions on the same topic at the time of practice. If you notice that you are repeating questions while solving questions, immediately switch to different types of questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adding new layers of meaning to the subject you are learning is elaboration. An example of this is expressing a topic in your own words while taking notes and examining its relationship with real life. Examining the relationship of the newly learned subject with what you have learned before increases learning. Relate the topic to yourself and your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Produce before learning. Trying to solve a math question with what you know before the answer is given makes it easier for you to grasp and remember the solution after the solution is explained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Blend recall and detailing. After a topic or class, ask yourself, “How did it go? Could it be better? Does this remind you of something from the past?” Asking questions like these helps learning, and this is called &lt;strong>reflection&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
